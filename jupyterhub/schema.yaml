  hub:
    type: object

      cookieSecret:
        type: string
        description: |
          A 64-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to sign values of
          secure cookies set by the hub. If unset, jupyterhub will generate one on startup and
          save it in the file `jupyterhub_cookie_secret` in the `/srv/jupyterhub` directory of
          the hub container. Value set here will override the value in `jupyterhub_cookie_secret`.

          You do not need to set this at all if you are using the default configuration for
          storing databases - sqlite on a persistent volume (with `hub.db.type` set to the
          default `sqlite-pvc`). If you are using an external database, then you must set this
          value explicitly - or your users will keep getting logged out each time the hub pod
          restarts.

          This must be generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`.

          Changing this value will all user logins to be invalidated. If this secret leaks,
          *immediately* change it to something else, or user data can be compromised
      extraConfig:
        type: string

          Arbitrary extra python based configuration that should be in `jupyterhub_config.py`.

          This is the *escape hatch* - if you want to configure JupyterHub to do something specific
          that is not present here as an option, you can just write the raw Python to do it here.

          Non-exhaustive examples of things you can do here:
            - Subclass authenticator / spawner to do a custom thing
            - Dynamically launch different images for different sets of images
            - Inject an auth token from GitHub authenticator into user pod
            - Anything else you can think of!

          Since this is usually a multi-line string, you want to format it using YAML's
          [| operator](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2795688).

          For example:
            ```
            hub:
              extraConfig: |
                c.JupyterHub.something = 'something'
                c.Spawner.somethingelse = 'something else'

          No validation of this python is performed! If you make a mistake here, it will probably
          manifest as either the hub pod going into `Error` or `CrashLoopBackoff` states, or in
          some special cases, the hub running but... just doing very random things. Be careful!
  proxy:
    type: object
    properties:
      secretToken:
        type: string
        description: |
          A 64-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to secure communications
          between the hub and the configurable-http-proxy.

          This must be generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`.

          Changing this value will cause the proxy and hub pods to restart. It is good security
          practice to rotate these values over time. If this secret leaks, *immediately* change
          it to something else, or user data can be compromised
    required:
      - secretToken
