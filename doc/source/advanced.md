# Advanced Topics

This page contains a grab bag of various useful topics that don't have an easy
home elsewhere:

- Arbitrary code in `jupyterhub_config.py`
- Picking a Scheduler Strategy
- Pre-pulling Images for Faster Startup

Most people setting up JupyterHubs on popular public clouds
should not have to use any of this information, but it is essential for more
complex installations.

## Arbitrary code in `jupyterhub_config.py`

Sometimes the various options exposed via the helm-chart's `values.yaml` is not
enough, and you need to insert arbitrary extra code / config into
`jupyterhub_config.py`. This is a valuable escape hatch for both prototyping new
features that are not yet present in the helm-chart, and also for
installation-specific customization that is not suited for upstreaming.

There are four properties you can set in your `config.yaml` to do this.

### `hub.extraConfig`

The value specified for `hub.extraConfig` is evaluated as python code at the end
of `jupyterhub_config.py`. You can do anything here since it is arbitrary Python
Code. Some examples of things you can do:

1. Override various methods in the Spawner / Authenticator by subclassing them.
   For example, you can use this to pass authentication credentials for the user
   (such as GitHub OAuth tokens) to the environment. See
   [the JupyterHub docs](http://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/authenticators.html#authentication-state) for
   an example.
2. Specify traitlets that take callables as values, allowing dynamic per-user
   configuration.
3. Set traitlets for JupyterHub / Spawner / Authenticator that are not currently
   supported in the helm chart

Unfortunately, you have to write your python *in* your YAML file. There's no way
to include a file in `config.yaml`.

You can specify `hub.extraConfig` as a raw string (remember to use the `|` for multi-line
YAML strings):

```yaml
hub:
  extraConfig: |
    import time
    c.Spawner.environment += {
       "CURRENT_TIME": str(time.time())
    }
```

You can also specify `hub.extraConfig` as a dictionary, if you want to logically
split your customizations. The code will be evaluated in alphabetical sorted
order of the key.

```yaml
hub:
  extraConfig:
   00-first-config: |
     # some code
   10-second-config: |
     # some other code
```

### `hub.extraConfigMap`

This property takes a dictionary of values that are then made available for code
in `hub.extraConfig` to read using a `z2jh.get_config` function. You can use this to
easily separate your code (which goes in `hub.extraConfig`) from your config
(which should go here).

For example, if you use the following snippet in your config.yaml file:

```yaml
hub:
  extraConfigMap:
    myString: Hello!
    myList:
      - Item1
      - Item2
    myDict:
      key: value
    myLongString: |
      Line1
      Line2
```

In your `hub.extraConfig`,

1. `z2jh.get_config('custom.myString')` will return a string `"Hello!"`
2. `z2jh.get_config('custom.myList')` will return a list `["Item1", "Item2"]`
3. `z2jh.get_config('custom.myDict')` will return a dict `{"key": "value"}`
4. `z2jh.get_config('custom.myLongString')` will return a string `"Line1\nLine2"`
5. `z2jh.get_config('custom.nonExistent')` will return `None` (since you didn't
    specify any value for `nonExistent`)
6. `z2jh.get_config('custom.myDefault', True)` will return `True`, since that is
    specified as the second parameter (default)

You need to have a `import z2jh` at the top of your `extraConfig` for
`z2jh.get_config()` to work.

Note that the keys in `hub.extraConfigMap` must be alpha numeric strings
starting with a character. Dashes and Underscores are not allowed.

### `hub.extraEnv`

This property takes a dictionary that is set as environment variables in the hub
container. You can use this to either pass in additional config to code in your
`hub.extraConfig` or set some hub parameters that are not settable by other means.

### `hub.extraContainers`

A list of extra containers that are bundled alongside the hub container in the
same pod. This is a
[common pattern](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2015/06/the-distributed-system-toolkit-patterns.html) in
kubernetes that as a long list of cool use cases. Some example use cases are:

1. Database Proxies, which are sometimes required for the hub to talk to its
   configured database
   (in [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy)) for example
2. Servers / other daemons that are used by code in your `hub.customConfig`

The items in this list must be valid kubernetes
[container specifications](https://kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1.8/#container-v1-core).
