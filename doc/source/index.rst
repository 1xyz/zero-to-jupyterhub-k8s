Zero to JupyterHub
==================

Jupyterhub is a tool that allows you to quickly utilize cloud computing
infrastructure to manage a hub that enables users to interact remotely
with a computing environment that you specify. It is useful for when
you want to standardize the computing environment of many people (e.g.,
for a class of students), as well as for allowing people to access the
hub remotely.

This is a growing collection of information to help you set up your own
jupyterhub instance. It is in an early stage, so the information and
tools may change quickly. If you see anything that is wrong or have any
questions, feel free to reach out at the `issues page <https://github.com/choldgraf/zero_to_jupyterhub/issues>`_
