JupyterHub on OpenShift
-----------------------

[OpenShift](https://openshift.org/) from RedHat is a cluster manager based on Kubernetes.

For setting up JupyterHub on OpenShift, checking out the [JupyterHub on OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/jupyterhub-quickstart)
project. It provides an OpenShift template based JupyterHub deployment. Zero to JupyterHub uses
[helm](https://helm.sh) which is currently not very compatible with OpenShift.
