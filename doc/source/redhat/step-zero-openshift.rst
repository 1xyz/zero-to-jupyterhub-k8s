JupyterHub on OpenShift
-----------------------

[OpenShift](https://openshift.org/) from RedHat is a cluster manager based on Kubernetes.
This guide uses [helm](https://helm.sh), which is unfortunately not well supported on OpenShift.

We recommend checking out the [JupyterHub on OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/jupyterhub-quickstart)
project instead. It provides an OpenShift template based JupyterHub installation.

- An excellent series of OpenShift blog posts on Jupyter and OpenShift
  authored by Red Hat developer, Graham Dumpleton, are
  available on the `OpenShift blog <https://blog.openshift.com/tag/jupyter/>`_.
