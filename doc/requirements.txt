# Order matters:
# - myst-parser depends on "sphinx>=2,<4"
# - pydata-sphinx-theme depends on "sphinx"
# - sphinx-copybutton depends on "sphinx>=1.8"
#
# Listing either pydata-sphinx-theme or sphinx-copybutton first will make the
# myst-parser constraints on sphinx be ignored, so myst-parser should go
# first. This is only relevant if sphinx==1.* is already installed in the
# environment, which it is on ReadTheDocs.
