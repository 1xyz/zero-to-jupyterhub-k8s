# Zero to Jupyterhub with Kubernetes

**This is a work in process. Useful for guidance not detailed instructions currently**

This repository will contain the documentation source code for people to get started with
JupyterHub using Kubernetes.

Much of the intial groundwork for this documentation is information learned from
the successful use of JupyterHub and Kubernetes at UC Berkeley in their
[Data 8](http://data8.org/) program.

We will host this documentation on Read The Docs as we move forward and may also
host a mirror at a the corresponding
website (see the link at the top of our github repo page).
